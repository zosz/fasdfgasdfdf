This category will be showing most common errors, the causes and the solution(if simple) for end-users and developers.
Due to the overhead of the amount of errors, You can just Ctrl+f and type part of the error to find it faster than scrolling.

Rather than having errors spread across several repositories/discord servers/sites, I figured it'd be much more convenient to put all common errors in one spot.

Most people won't be looking at this as no one likes to read anyway, so I just put it here as a reference for whoever likes to read.
