`tera-proxy` adds script modding to TERA. It's totally free and open source.

Tired of having to receive Vanguard rewards after completing a Vanguard quest? Tired of mashing your Esc button when it's time to see a cutscene for the hundredth time? How about some modules that automatically turn in Vanguard quests when you complete them, and automatically skip cutscenes before they even start?

Or maybe you want to emulate skills clientside so you can avoid that annoying ping tax? You can't get rid of latency, but you can at least do 10 ms rotations at 200 ms ping.

If you just want to use the proxy, check the [user guide]({{ '/user-guide' | absolute_url }}), then head on over to the [module directory]({{ '/modules' | absolute_url }}) to see what nifty scripts you can install.

If you want to make modules, have a look at the [developer guide]({{ '/developer-guide' | absolute_url }}).

Currently, there is no nice GUI and there is no autoupdating for this version of tera-proxy, but until then, you're just going to have to download a fresh copy every TERA patch.

You most likely won't get caught for quality of life modules or clientside only modules. However, do be careful who sees screenshots, streams, or videos of your game. Don't blame the developers as they take no responsibility if you do something dumb and/or blatant and get banned.

Furthermore, tera-proxy is **not** intended for cheating. It is unfortunate that the server allows quite a bit of it, but just because you *can* doesn't mean you *should*. While the line between cheating and not cheating is a gray area subject to each individual's opinions, use common sense and stay on the safe side. Any usage of tera-proxy to exploit TERA is not supported, and any discussion of it will not be allowed on the GitHub nor on the Discord.
